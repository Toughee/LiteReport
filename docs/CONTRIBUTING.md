# Contributing:

PR requests and issues are always welcomed

Please follow the issue template guideline before commiting and new pull requests

## Guidelines:

1. Fork the repository and set the main repository as the upstream remote

'''git remote add upstream git@github.com:litereport/litereport.git'''

2. Make a new branch with the new PR following these naming conventions:

'''
issue/##/name-of-issue-or-PR
'''

* Whereas '''##''' would be the issue number

3. Run tests to ensure that nothing has broken with the new upcoming PR

4. Push to the master branch and wait for a review
